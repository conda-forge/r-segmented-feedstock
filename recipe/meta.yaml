  summary: "Given a regression model, segmented `updates' it by adding one or more segmented (i.e., piece-wise linear) relationships. Several variables with multiple breakpoints are allowed. The estimation method is discussed in Muggeo (2003, <doi:10.1002/sim.1545>) and illustrated in Muggeo (2008, <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-1.pdf>).
    An approach for hypothesis testing is presented in Muggeo (2016, <doi:10.1080/00949655.2016.1149855>), and interval estimation for the breakpoint is discussed in Muggeo (2017, <doi:10.1111/anzs.12200>).  "
